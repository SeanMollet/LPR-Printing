# RKP
A C# implementation of lpr/lpq print client as per RFC1179

This is a direct replacement for the Windows lpr.exe and lpq.exe command line tools. Microsoft has announced it is deprecating the LPD service in Windows so I expect these tools to go as well.

The command line options are the same as the existing tools.

An LPD service will follow soon.
